# Airbnb Listings Dashboard (Tableau)
Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexanderfreberg/airbnb-listings-2016-dataset


This project explores Airbnb listings data to uncover pricing patterns, popular neighborhoods, and availability trends. The goal was to build a dashboard that helps users—whether travelers, hosts, or analysts—understand the Airbnb market better at a glance.

## Why I Built This

I wanted to work on a real-world dataset that wasn’t just about numbers, but about people, places, and choices. Airbnb data gave me that. I explored the dataset, cleaned it, and used Tableau to design an interactive dashboard that simplifies complexity while keeping insights clear and actionable.

## Key Features

- **Neighborhood Insights**: Average price, availability, and listing count by neighborhood.
- **Room Type Analysis**: Comparison of pricing and availability across different room types.
- **Interactive Filters**: Date range, room type, price slider, and neighborhood filter.
- **KPIs**: Quick-glance metrics for total listings, average price, and availability.
- **Map View**: Visual distribution of listings across the city.

## Tools & Skills Used

- **Tableau** – for data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Excel** – for initial data cleanup and prep.
- **Data Cleaning** – handled missing values, filtered irrelevant entries.
- **Exploratory Analysis** – identified trends and outliers to focus dashboard design.
